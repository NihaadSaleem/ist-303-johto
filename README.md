Project Concept

We are building an AI-powered Alumni Network Dashboard to bridge meaningful connections between students and alumni.  

This dashboard will:
- Leverage agentic AI capabilities to surface real-time, contextual insights from alumni data.  
- Be powered by ChatGPT (via API key) as the large language model (LLM), integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enable intelligent querying of unstructured content.  
  - If RAG cannot be implemented, we will loop back to SQL and assume the data is structured (leveraging our Database expert).  
- Be developed in partnership with AI Squared (pending approval), who will build the Insight Agent Dashboard interface.  
- Enable CGU or any participating university to visualize, search, and interact with alumni data to:  
  1. Discover and connect with potential mentors  
  2. Trace alumni career paths and outcomes  
  3. Identify trends and generate AI-driven connection suggestions
